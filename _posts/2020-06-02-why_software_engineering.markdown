March 27th, 2020. That was the last day I worked here in New York, right around the start of the pandemic we're going through, and honestly, I can say I've made the most of it. I had to make the choice to stop coming into work, since here at home both my mother and I are immunosuppressed. It sucked, but it was what I had to do to keep my family safe. 

In the time that I've been home, I've been able to work on building my PC and losing weight. With the downtime I've had, I've been able to lose almost 20 lbs! I also realized quickly, after seeing how my job responded to the pandemic, that I would need to start looking into a new career. 

I had heard a lot about coding bootcamps, and decided to give CareerKarma a try, and was quickly matched with a plethora of schools. It was all overwhelming, but after scheduling a few one on ones with students from different schools and bootcamps, it seemed like an easy choice - Flatiron. It was local (not that it matters right now, but still meant something to rep NY), and it seemed to have great reviews from students across the board. I just had to pick a field of study. I had the choices of data science, UI/UX, and software engineering. Data science reminded me a lot of statistics, which wasn't really a favorite of mine back when I was in school, and UI/UX just didn't pique my interests. Software engineering though, sounded like a lot of fun. I happened to take a Java class back in high school, and could remember a little bit of the concepts from it. I knew it was gonna be a challenge, but I love challenges and I love learning new things, and so far I know for a fact that I picked the right program. I'm excited everyday to learn new concepts and take coding to the next level, and the aha moment when you finally figure out a tough lab, is one of the most rewarding feelings you can get. 

I know this was the right choice, and I can't wait to take this to the next step, and start my new career!
